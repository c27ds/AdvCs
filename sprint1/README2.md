Project Overview
    Our project is creating an algorithmically powered autonomous trading program, utilizing quantitative trading strategies to execute trades without human involvement. Our goal, which may require more time than six weeks to complete, is to eventually develop an algorithm product comparable to those available in the market. Through this project, we will explore applications of computer science in the finance sector, while learning a new language and getting experience in developing an algorithm for a specified purpose.
Motivation
    We are interested in this project because finance and investing is a shared passion of ours. In the current investment banking landscape few things are more prevalent than algo-trading. The shared appeal of high accuracy and no human involvement allow algorithmic trading to execute a higher volume of trades with lower error margins consistently over long periods of time without having to be constantly monitored. Additionally, this project comes with the added benefit of us learning about the basics of quantitative trading and getting practice in developing an algorithm to meet a goal, both of which will be important for us going forward.
Required Tools and Technologies
    We are planning to use the language PineScript, which is similar to Python except is customized to work with the platform Trading View, a professionally used source of financial data. TradingView will also be our main database for this project, and this can be accessed through PineScript.
Resources
    At present, we do not plan to purchase any resources, as we are hoping to pilot this idea and ensure that it has potential to be effective. In the future, we may purchase a more advanced plan on TradingView that would enable our model to utilize more extensive data.
Project Backlog
