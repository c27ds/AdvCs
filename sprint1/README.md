Quantitative Trading Algorithm
    Team Members
      Daniel Silverman and Shreyas Rajaram
  Summary
    One sentence pitch for your project to Loryn Croot (no jargon ????, value proposition first).
      We would like to develop an algorithmically powered autonomous trading program, utilizing quantitative trading strategies to execute trades without human involvement.
    An additional brief description of your project. Who is the audience?
      We would like to develop an automated trading algorithm designed to autonomously perform trades. We believe that our project has applications both for retail traders and potential investors as well as corporate investing applications.
  Resources
    What programming languages, frameworks, or technologies might you want to use? 
      We are planning to use the language PineScript, which is similar to Python except is customized to work with the platform Trading View, a professionally used source of financial data. 
    Are there outside databases or APIs that you think might be helpful? 
      TradingView would be our main database for this project, and this can be accessed through PineScript.
    Can you list a couple books or articles that are relevant to your project?
      For our project, we are planning to use the following quant research paper as a resource for brainstorming and ideation. There are also other resources on quantbase.com and other research websites that could prove to be useful for our project.
    Are there any products you might want to purchase? 
      At present, we do not plan to purchase any resources, as we are hoping to pilot this idea and ensure that it has potential to be effective. In the future, we may purchase a more advanced plan on TradingView that would enable our model to utilize more extensive data.
  Tasks
      Understand market moving factors
        Work with members of the math staff (Manuel, Garbasz) as well as conduct online research into different algorithms as well as the concepts behind them in order to optimize them for our own use
      Learn Pinescript (the built-in language of TradingView)
        Learn syntax
      Implement our preferred strategy in Pinescript
        Consider the best way to translate our math to code 
        Debug the code as needed
        Streamline the strategy for fast execution and low load. 
        Automate buy/sell
        Test the program in any way possible
      Backtest strategies to ensure maximum benefit
        Check historical results using our algorithm
      Shortlist three more strategies to test
        See which strategy has the greatest impact on historical data and implement it
      Explore the technological side of investing: hardware options
        Proximity of device to exchange, internet speed
        Different platforms/ chipsets etc
      Potentially translate into a more optimal language than Pinescript
        The language used differs from firm to firm but there seems to be potential in function based coding languages like OCAML(Jane Street), overall just reducing the runtime and lag of programs to make the fastest action on the market
  Additional Notes
        There are uncertainties in how far we will get in six weeks, since a large part of the work will be research, both online and in discussions with experts. However, within six weeks, we should certainly have an algorithm as a product, and we could potentially explore alternatives and optimization in the future.
